      question: 'When is the best time to use orthotic insoles?',
      description:
          'a. Over 90% of the people assume that pain is the price to pay that comes with old age and it is NOT TRUE!\n\nb. During the basic 12 years of studied at school we were never taught in schools by teachers, at home by our parents and not even during our working life by our superiors and colleagues. The major contribution to such pain is IGNORANT!\n\nc. It is often when the pain has become unbearable, our foot and legs are deformed and we consulted our therapist and/or doctors, that causes are revealed and it may be too late for some.\n\nd. Orthotic insoles should be worn during pre-school as that is when young kidsarer most active and they have already start wearing shoes. It serves as a mean to provide better balance, stability and protection against over-pronation that would cause 80% of joint pain when they grow older.'),
